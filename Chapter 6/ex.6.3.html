       <h1>GREEN HOME ENVIRONMENT</h1>  
       <h2>Going Green</h2>
   </header>
   <section id="one">
       <p>This day and age, you hear everyone talking about going green. Whether you want to admit it or not, at some point everyone will have to follow the green movement. This is because at the rate we are going, the earth is simply not sustainable. That means that over the years, we will begin to run out of certain natural resources that are needed in order for us to survive. That is alarming to some people, which is why there are so many people that focus on green building. But, what exactly is a green building? Let's take a closer look at what it is, why you should consider it, and what the goals of a green building are. You are sure to find that it is something that you should take part in.</p>
       <p >Getting Greener conducted a green audit for a family of five that lives east of Seattle. Getting Greener found that the homeowner used more electricity than the average household. We recommended that they install solar panels to provide all of their electrical energy. Any additional energy produced by the panels could be sold back to the public utility company. The homeowners also invested in an electric car that runs on the solar electric energy provided by the panels.</p> 
       <p>Come see our demo in person this Saturday and Sunday! The green audit showed us how many panels the home needed, based on the family's average electricity consumption. This family's consumption includes an energy-efficient furnace and air conditioner, energy-efficient appliances, energy-efficient windows and doors, and energy-efficient lightbulbs throughout the house.</p>

       <h3>Electric Car</h3> 
       <p>The homeowners also invested in an electric car to make their lives more green. The car is plugged into an outlet in the garage, so the power needed to run the car comes completely from the solar panels mentioned above. There are many energy efficient cars on the market today. Some states have tax incentives for people who buy these cars. Review reports online to see which car might best suit your needs.</p>
