            <p class="tiny">p.s this is in order from a-b by author's last name, unless no known author, then that comes first (Ex; The Mahabaratha). Also, when clicking a link, it will lead you to an external page, because unfortunately I don't own them.</p>
       <h2>Poems & Epics</h2>
       <p><a href="https://ia803400.us.archive.org/7/items/the-complete-mahabharata/The%20Complete%20Mahabharata%20.pdf" target="_blank">Mahabaratha</a> - It's... very long. Author: Unknown. It's thought to be the longest epic.. ever..? 1.8 million words. I suggest a<a href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Mahabharata/" target="_blank"> summary,</a> or simply<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabharata" target="_blank"> wiki,</a> scholar.</p>
       <!--Add the odyssey, illiad, aenied, dover beach, wasteland, goblin market, make sure to mention it's size and author. -->
       <h2>Novellas & Short Stories</h2>
       <p></p>
      <!--sort it by works on one page, then you can chose to find something instead by the author. So if someone is looking for lets say In A Grove by Ryunosuke, they'd have to go to authors, then the twirl, then In A Grove. "Works" will work more as a uh.. dictionary of sorts? like just browsing, looking for something to randomly read. MAYBE ALSO include other demogrraphics like where in the world (add a map section of authors and make a graph of authors alive during what times. ex: 1500s-1900s lived uh.. franz kafka. LIke do a graph thing for that and stuff. make that a different page other than "works" and what will soon be "authors.")-->
