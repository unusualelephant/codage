       <p>Welcome to Literature Looker,a place to explore a boundless sum of knowledge. Otherwise known as the place where I store a bunch of links.</p>
  
       
       <p>Please take a look around! We've got the <a class="strong">Browse</a> section that allows you to look through all works posted so far, <a class="strong">Authors</a> which is exactly what it sounds like-just authors and their works. Please don't forget the <a class="strong">Demographics!</a> Very important (though not nearly as interesting as the other pages) graphs, timelines, and periods & eras that authors have contributed, and continue to add on to to this day!</p>
